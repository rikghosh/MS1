# Wealth Inequality and Income Level of African Countries

The Gini coefficient of a region is a numerical measure of its wealth inequality. It varies from zero to one (or zero to 100, depending on scale), with higher numbers indicating a greater level of inequality.

The World Bank, furthermore, groups countries into five income level groups: low income, lower middle income, upper middle income, high income OECD, and high income Non-OECD. They fit countries into these groups based on their per capita Gross National Income (GNI) and, for the last two, whether or not they are members of the OECD.  

This visualization groups African countries by income group. Only four groups are displayed since no African countries are members of the OECD. Within each group, it displays the spread of Gini coefficients for the constituent countries, facilitating a comparative analysis of wealth inequality and income level. 

More specifically, it shows the range of wealth inequality across each group, as well as the precise distribution of individual elements within that range. In doing so, it allows for comparison between income groups, as well, to provide an understanding of precisely how wealth inequality relates to income level in Africa. 

Though the Gini coefficient varies from zero to 100 in theory, the plot is bounded by 30 and 62 to maximize clarity for the particular Gini values in the data. For contextual reference, a light bar displays the Gini coefficient of the United States. Each African country is represented by a point, and hovering over such a point displays the country's name and Gini coefficient value. Additionally, clicking on a point yields an editorial statement, which synthesizes the information contained across the plot for that country, and, for clarity and transparency, provides additional information about the specific data source and collection date for that point.
